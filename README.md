# Graph NN with Autograd for chemical systems

## Eventually will do the (RoadMap) Not in order
- [ ] Layers
- [ ] MEssagwe Passing
- [ ] Advanced AUtograd
- [ ] Swfit support for metal gpu
- [ ] compiling functionality
- [ ] sharding
- [ ] Turn message passing into module
- [ ] Increase aggregation functionality
- [ ] In autograd add tensor indexing to get to work with message passing
- [ ] In autograd add a scatter operation (optimised)
- [ ] Add mathematics in here
- [ ] reference both papers for PaiNN and SchNet
- [ ] Add correct typing for each class/function
- [ ] Add compatibility to float and tensor operations
