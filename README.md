# Graph NN with Autograd for chemical systems

this is basic implementation with proof of concept using just autograd developed without torch etc. Initial implementation is to support foundations which will be implemented in JAX in later update with more functionality. The end goal is for NAD systems
\\
Building off the PaiNN paper to generate a multi coupled state version for NAD.
